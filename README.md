# AsSeenOnTheInternet (ASotI "uh-SOH-tee")
Collection of Unity games created by me in response to things I've seen as 
advertisements on-line

## Current Game List
All games include a "Builds" folder which contains a desktop executable along 
with a set of other select options such as (but not limited to) OS X desktop 
applications, Android applications, iOS/ Apple Store applications, Facebook 
Gameroom applications, WebGL links and files, and/or Console builds (Xbox, 
Playstation, etc).

### Cube Runner (ASotI 01)
**see https://github.com/ceheckel/AsSeenOnTheInternet/tree/master/ASotI_CubeRunner/Builds to download a version that is right for you**

A Cube Runner variant created using tutorials from youtube.com/Brackeys as an 
introduction to the Unity engine and IDE.

The game features three extremely difficult pre-developed level with glidey 
controls and various 'stages' per level.

Each stage contains a different obstacle type, and new challenges to overcome.
Brackeys' tutorials discuss basic game components such enemies, player 
characters, scene development, start menus/end menus, music/sound effects, 
scripting, and several other key components to video games.  All content 
discussed in Brackeys' tutorial series has been implemented into this first 
game.

### Ice Breaker (ASotI 02)
**see https://github.com/ceheckel/AsSeenOnTheInternet/tree/master/ASotI_IceBreaker/Builds to download a version that is right for you**

Ice Breaker is a 2-dimensional [Bubble Shooter](http://www.bubblegame.org/) style game in which the 
objective is to clear the playing field by hitting the ice blocks with your 
launched ice breaking boats a set number of times, the number of times each 
object needs to be hit is determined by the density of the sprite, and levels 
are be randomly generated.

### Spindle (ASotI 03)
**see https://github.com/ceheckel/AsSeenOnTheInternet/tree/master/ASotI_Spindle/Builds to download a version that is right for you**

Spindle is my take on an unidentified game found in an on-line advertisement.
The game features a 3-dimensional spindle shape of infinite length with 
flywheel-esk objects attached to it.  Each wheel has a notch, or gap, in it 
which the player must manipulate the position of to allow a bouncing ball to 
fall through to the next level.  The flywheels all have an off-colored section 
that the ball cannot touch without the game ending.  The position, size, and 
mobility of each flywheel is procedurally generated.

### Outta the Park (ASotI 04)
**Not yet in development**

Outta the Park is a backyard baseball slugger's dream.  The game features a 3-
dimensional field of view and procedurally generated obstacles such as trees, 
buildings, rivers, bridges, cars, and many more.  The objective of the game is 
to hit a baseball as far 'outta the park' as possible with the player's score 
incrementing with distance.  

### Protect the Balloon (ASotI 05)
**Development in Progress**

Protect the balloon is a 2d single player mobile game in which the goal is to 
prevent procedurally spawned objects from falling onto your balloon.  The 
player uses their finger to swipe away the objects.  The players score 
increments with each passing second.
