# AsSeenOnTheInternet (ASotI "uh-SOH-tee")
Collection of Unity games created by me in response to things I've seen as advertisements online

## Current Game List
All games include a "Builds" folder which contains a desktop executable along with a set of other select options such as (but not limited to) OS X desktop applications, Android applications, iOS/ Apple Store applications, Facebook Gameroom applications, WebGL links and files, and/or Console builds (Xbox, Playstation, etc).

### Cube Runner (ASotI 01)
A Cube Runner variant created using tutorials from youtube.com/Brackeys as an introduction to the Unity engine and IDE.
The game features three extremely difficult pre-developed level with glidy controls and various 'stages' per level.
Each stage contains a different obstacle type, and new challenges to overcome.
Brackeys' tutorials discuss basic game components such enemies, player characters, scene development, start menus/end menus,
music/sound effects, scripting, and several other key components to video games.  All content discussed in Brackeys' tutorial series has
been implemented into this first game

### Ice Breaker (ASotI 02)
**Development in Progress**
Ice Breaker is a 2-dimensional [Bubble Shooter](http://www.bubblegame.org/) style game in which the objective is to clear the playing
field by hitting each object with your projectile a set number of times, the number of times each object needs to be hit will be displayed
on the face of the block, and levels will be randomly generated.

### Spindle (ASotI 03)
**Not yet in development**

Spindle is my take on an unidentified game found in a Facebook advertisement labelled "I challenge you to beat me".
The game features a 3-dimensional spindle shape of infinite length with flywheel-esk objects attached to it.  Each wheel has a notch, or
gap, in it which the player must manipulate the position of to allow a bouncing ball to fall through to the next level.  The flywheel's 
all have an off-colored section that the ball cannot touch without the game ending.  The position, size, and mobility of each flywheel is
prodecurally generated.

### Outta the Park (ASotI 04)
**Not yet in development**

Outta the Park is a backyard baseball slugger's dream.  The game features a 3-dimensional field of view and procedurally generated
obstacles such as trees, buildings, rivers, bridges, cars, and many more.  The objective of the game is to hit a baseball as far 'outta
the park' as possible with the player's score incrementing with distance.
